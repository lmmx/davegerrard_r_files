Email from Dave:

> For those who would like to follow along on their laptop in tomorrow's session, you will need to install some Bioconductor packages and bring the attached script file [BSgenome.BioStrings.bioC.R] and data file [GSE19635_s96a_peaks.txt].
>
> To install the Bioconductor packages, connect to the internet, open your R prompt or Rstudio and type (copy/paste) these two lines:-
>

> ```
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3")    
```

> This will install a yeast genome as a package and should also install Biostrings, BSgenomes and GenomicRanges if not already installed. If you've not used Bioconductor before, this may take a few minutes to download and install everything.

The 2 attached files are uploaded in this repository.
